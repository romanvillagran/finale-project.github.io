                <p>The first know recording of Pozole was back in the 16th-century when a Spanish missionary arrived in Mexico in 1529. In Florentine Codex, Fay Bernardino de Sahagun documented rituals, daily life and the culture of the Aztec people. Not to learn about who and how they lived, but to better understand how to undermine their gods and ultimately convert the Aztec people to Christianity.
                </p>
                <p>A dish Sahagun encounter during during his stay was tlacatlaolli. He described the dish as "a maize stew fed to the captors and his family at the time when they would also be eating a piece of the flesh of the captive after his heart was removed for offering to the deities" or it contained human flesh from a human sacrifice</p>
                <p>During pre-colonial times, the meat they would use for non-ceremonial Pozole was called Tepezcuintle which is a breed of dog or itzcuintlis, another dog breed used in Mexican cuisine from 1500s to the 1600s. According to research by the Gobierno de Mexico</p>

                <p>FUN FACT: the only reason pork is used in Pozole is because cannibalism was banned and then they started using pork because it tasted very similar to human flesh</p>
